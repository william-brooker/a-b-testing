# A-B-testing: How does a new variation of a mobile landing webpage affecct a consumers behaviour?

In this project I was approached by a E-commerce business who wanted to see how their new variation of the mobile site effected users behaviours, inparticularly how their conversion rates and spending changed when exchanged to the new banner.

In this repositry I have PDFs of my presentation to the stakeholders, my written report of the analysis and my excel sheet for anaysis and the SQL querry I used to extract the data from the database.
